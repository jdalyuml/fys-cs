Grades will be given on a contract basis.
To receive an A, you must attend at least 11/13 classes, do 3/4 of the homework assignments, and \st{attend at least 4 CS Colloquia, department talks, or UML-ACM presentations}.  
Homework is graded on a credit/no-credit basis.
Do not wait until the end of the semester to attend events as there may not be sufficient events for you to attend.

Students who meet all of the requirements for one rank and some (but not all) of the requirements for the next rank will have their grade raised by one step for each criteria (e.g. from a B to a B+).

\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}\hline

    B & 9 & 2/3 & \st{3} 0 \\
    C & 7 & 1/2 & \st{2} 0  \\
    D & 6 & 1/3 & \st{1} 0 \\

For the \emph{Fall 2020} semester, the Colloquia requirement is waived.
