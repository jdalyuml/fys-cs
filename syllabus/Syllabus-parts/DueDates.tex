Homework is due on Blackboard at the times indicated (usually the beginning of class).  Late assignments will {\em not} be accepted without
prior approval.  Students must consult with the instructor at least
three days prior to the scheduled due date to make alternative
arrangements.  The instructor is under no obligation to grant any such
request.
