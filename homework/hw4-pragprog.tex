For this assignment, you will read about how to make your projects a little more manageable.

Read \textbf{Topic 9: DRY - The Evils of Duplication} and \textbf{Topic 27: Don't Outrun your Headlights} from \emph{The Pragmatic Programmer} by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt.
Afterwards, write a short response in which you answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Think about your own work.  Do you find yourself trying to build the entire program at once, or do you compile and run every couple lines to see how it work?
	\item How often do you find yourself repeating yourself, either in function or intent?
	\item Is there anything that you would change about your approach to programming?
\end{itemize}

Submit your response on Blackboard.
